Hi Sunglyoung,

Your map clearly shows the locations of public wifi in Manhattan and the transparency of the red dots makes it easy to see where there are multiple hotspots right next to each other.  I think the grey outlines are property lines for each building, but I'm not certain.  Clarifying what the gray lines represent would clear this up.

Since the map is clearly titled and the exact coordinates of the wifi hotspots are not all the important compared to there relative position on the map, I think you could remove some or all of the ticks on both axes.  The state coordinate numbers are less useful than latitude and longitude if it's possible to replace the ticks with that.

Your plot's area shows all of Manhattan, but this does create some extra white space on the left side.  Possibly removing Ellis, Liberty and Governor's islands from the map would be fair since they don't have wifi hotspots on them and the plot would show more of the pertinent areas of Manhattan in terms of wifi hotspots.
