This is HW10

Which is analysis of entire of NYC subway ridership in timeseries

First, find the event detector and it found the abnormal event, which is Sandy.

Second, finding each 23 type of card type of stationary test. Which cardtype increase and decrease.

Top 5 and bottom 5 is indicated.

Third, Find top 4 stations that have annual period.

Extra credit. I tried PCA analysis and plot the 600 statoin on 2D PCA. 

I made a mask for entire 600 station that is above median and below median. However, I coudn't show up the boolean on graph. 


Thank you
