Hello,

The graph shows SAT Math score is directly proportional to Reading score, no matter the school size.

However, I had hard time to read label and title. Also there is no legend for School student size. I wish there is legend for bubble size so I could understand how small and how big is.

If there is boro different by color it would give more insight of the graph!

Thank you


# FBB I specifically asked the plots to be included in the review and the review to touch 3 topics: esthetics clarity and honesty. While there are some good comments here you did not follow the rules.
