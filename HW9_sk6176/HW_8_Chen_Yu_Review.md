This is a good plot and clearly shows what you have done.

However, the claim has to be normalized by population in ZIP code boundary and shorted by jenks rather than quailtile.

The number shows there is out-liners so I would take it out out-liners.

Thank you so much!

# FBB I asked to include the plot in your review md file and to review on three topics: clarity, esthetics, honesty. Songlyoung, you need to read the instructions more carefully! You are losing a lot of points because you just do not read and respect the instructions
